# Functional Koans - F# #

**NOTE**: This is a modified version of Chris Marinos' F# Koans. It has been adapted to be run using .NET Core.

Inspired by EdgeCase's fantastic [Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans),
the goal of the F# koans is to teach you F# through testing.

When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a
stack trace indicating where the error occured. Your goal is to make the
error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about
the F# language and functional programming in general.

Your journey towards F# enlightenment starts in the AboutAsserts.fs file. These
koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! As you progress through
more koans, more and more F# syntax will be introduced which will allow
you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.

### Getting Started

This edition of F# Koans targets .NET Core 2.0 and can be run on Windows, Mac and Linux.
The only prerequsite is [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/windows)

### Running the Koans
Open Koans folder and run:

```bash
koans
```

on Windows, or:

```bash

Use your favorite editor to edit files in `FSharpKoans` folder.
